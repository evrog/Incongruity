i walked into this posh restaurant , the prices were extortionate , it was daylight snobbery .
an unusual medical book is one which has no appendix .
follow your knows .
the man addicted to brake fluid said he could stop any time .
as soon as the airplane was invented , things were looking up .
boyle said he was under too much pressure .
watson and crick did the twist all night .
your nose is in the scenter of your face .
